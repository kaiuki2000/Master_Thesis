abstract="Clustering algorithms based on a matrix of pairwise similarities (kernel matrix) for the data are widely known and used, a particularly popular class being spectral clustering algorithms. In contrast, algorithms working with the pairwise distance matrix have been studied rarely for clustering. This is surprising, as in many applications, distances are directly given, and computing similarities involves another step that is error-prone, since the kernel has to be chosen appropriately, albeit computationally cheap. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based on the SDP relaxation of the max-k-cut of the graph of pairwise distances, based on the work of Frieze and Jerrum. We compare the algorithm with Yu and Shi's algorithm based on spectral relaxation of a norm-k-cut. Moreover, we propose a simple heuristic for dealing with missing data, i.e., the case where some of the pairwise distances or similarities are not known. We evaluate the algorithms on the task of clustering natural language terms with the Google distance, a semantic distance recently introduced by Cilibrasi and Vit{\'a}nyi, using relative frequency counts from WWW queries and based on the theory of Kolmogorov complexity.",

ABSTRACT={We provide Ising formulations for many NP-complete and NP-hard problems, including all of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. This collects and extends mappings to the Ising model from partitioning, covering, and satisfiability. In each case, the required number of spins is at most cubic in the size of the problem. This work may be useful in designing adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms.}

abstract = {We experimentally evaluate the performance of several Max Cut approximation algorithms. In particular, we compare the results of the Goemans and Williamson algorithm using semidefinite programming with Trevisan’s algorithm using spectral partitioning. The former algorithm has a known .878 approximation guarantee whereas the latter has a .614 approximation guarantee. We investigate whether this gap in approximation guarantees is evident in practice or whether the spectral algorithm performs as well as the SDP. We also compare the performances to the standard greedy Max Cut algorithm which has a .5 approximation guarantee, two additional spectral algorithms, and a heuristic from Burer, Monteiro, and Zhang (BMZ). The algorithms are tested on Erd\H{o}s–Renyi random graphs, complete graphs from TSPLIB, and real-world graphs from the Network Repository. We find, unsurprisingly, that the spectral algorithms provide a significant speed advantage over the SDP. In our experiments, the spectral algorithms and BMZ heuristic return cuts with values which are competitive with those of the SDP.},

abstract="Throughout the 1960s I worked on combinatorial optimization problems including logic circuit design with Paul Roth and assembly line balancing and the traveling salesman problem with Mike Held. These experiences made me aware that seemingly simple discrete optimization problems could hold the seeds of combinatorial explosions. The work of Dantzig, Fulkerson, Hoffman, Edmonds, Lawler and other pioneers on network flows, matching and matroids acquainted me with the elegant and efficient algorithms that were sometimes possible. Jack Edmonds' papers and a few key discussions with him drew my attention to the crucial distinction between polynomial-time and superpolynomial-time solvability. I was also influenced by Jack's emphasis on min-max theorems as a tool for fast verification of optimal solutions, which foreshadowed Steve Cook's definition of the complexity class NP. Another influence was George Dantzig's suggestion that integer programming could serve as a universal format for combinatorial optimization problems.",

    abstract = { Trevisan [SIAM J. Comput., 41 (2012), pp. 1769--1786] presented an algorithm for Max-Cut based on spectral partitioning techniques. This is the first algorithm for Max-Cut with an approximation guarantee strictly larger than 1/2 that is not based on semidefinite programming. Trevisan showed that its approximation ratio is of at least 0.531. In this paper we improve this bound up to 0.614247. We also define and extend this result for the more general maximum colored cut problem. }

abstract={Computational quantum technologies are entering a new phase in which noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers are available, but are still too small to benefit from active error correction. Even with a finite coherence budget to invest in quantum information processing, noisy devices with about 50 qubits are expected to experimentally demonstrate quantum supremacy in the next few years. Defined in terms of artificial tasks, current proposals for quantum supremacy, even if successful, will not help to provide solutions to practical problems. Instead, we believe that future users of quantum computers are interested in actual applications and that noisy quantum devices may still provide value by approximately solving hard combinatorial problems via hybrid classical-quantum algorithms. To lower bound the size of quantum computers with practical utility, we perform realistic simulations of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and conclude that quantum speedup will not be attainable, at least for a representative combinatorial problem, until several hundreds of qubits are available.},

The superconducting qubit modality has been used to demonstrate prototype algorithms in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology era, in which non-error-corrected qubits are used to implement quantum simulations and quantum algorithms. With the recent demonstrations of multiple high-fidelity, two-qubit gates as well as operations on logical qubits in extensible superconducting qubit systems, this modality also holds promise for the longer-term goal of building larger-scale error-corrected quantum computers. In this brief review, we discuss several of the recent experimental advances in qubit hardware, gate implementations, readout capabilities, early NISQ algorithm implementations, and quantum error correction using superconducting qubits. Although continued work on many aspects of this technology is certainly necessary, the pace of both conceptual and technical progress in recent years has been impressive, and here we hope to convey the excitement stemming from this progress.",

ABSTRACT = {The SAND algorithm is a family of lightweight AND-RX block ciphers released by DCC in 2022. Our research focuses on assessing the security of SAND with a quantum computation model. This paper presents the first quantum implementation of SAND (including two versions of SAND, SAND-64 and SAND-128). Considering the depth-times-width metric, the quantum circuit implementation of the SAND algorithm demonstrates a relatively lower consumption of quantum resources than that of the quantum implementations of existing lightweight algorithms. A generalized Grover-based brute-force attack framework was implemented and employed to perform attacks on two versions of the SAND algorithm. This framework utilized the g-database algorithm, which considered different plaintext–ciphertext pairs in a unified manner, reducing quantum resource consumption. Our findings indicate that the SAND-128 algorithm achieved the NIST security level I, while the SAND-64 algorithm fell short of meeting the requirements of security level I.},

abstract={At the intersection of machine learning and quantum computing, quantum machine learning has the potential of accelerating data analysis, especially for quantum data, with applications for quantum materials, biochemistry and high-energy physics. Nevertheless, challenges remain regarding the trainability of quantum machine learning models. Here we review current methods and applications for quantum machine learning. We highlight differences between quantum and classical machine learning, with a focus on quantum neural networks and quantum deep learning. Finally, we discuss opportunities for quantum advantage with quantum machine learning.},
