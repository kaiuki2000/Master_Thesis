\chapter{iQAQE Schemes and Results}
\label{chapter:Schemes_and_Results}

% Before I start mindlessly dumping things here, I should re-read everything on the logbook, so I have a better idea of what I want to say. Also, I shouldn't include all of what is said there, probably. I think I'll just write all that I want to say and, if need be, I'll cut some things in the end, once I'm re-reading the ENTIRE thing, again.

Insert your chapter material here. - In this chapter, we should present all the many schemes that we've come up with, and the results of the numerical simulations of these schemes. We should also compare the results of the different schemes, and discuss the potential of each one. We should also mention the importance of the results and the potential applications of the schemes. This will, surely, be the largest chapter of the thesis.

Here, I should present each realization of iQAQE, theoretically, as well as the results of the numerical simulations of each realization. I should also mention that this work is, essentially, a collection/compilation of different schemes/ideas, all inspired by the base-iQAQE algorithm, described above. As such, some schemes will appear disconnected from others, but they all serve the same purpose, ultimately. (This is how I should justify the existence of so many schemes, and the lack of a clear connection between them. Also, this is how one should look at this.)

I might re-order these a little.

% By default, this document supports file types {\it .png,.pdf,.jpg,,.jpeg}.

% See the documentation of package {\it graphicx} \url{https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/} for other extensions support.

% When referencing a figure, use the abbreviation Fig., unless it is the beginning of a sentence.

% \end{figure}


% % ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Equations}
% \label{subsection:equations}

% Equations can be inserted in different ways.

% The simplest way is in a separate line as

% \begin{equation}
%   \frac{{\rm d} q_{ijk}}{{\rm d} t} + {\cal R}_{ijk}({\bm q}) = 0 \,,
% \label{eq:ode}
% \end{equation}
% %
% where each variable must properly defined.

% If the equation is to be embedded in the text, it can be done like ${\partial {\cal R}}/{\partial {\bm q}}=0$.

% It may also be split in different lines like

% \begin{eqnarray}
%   {\rm Minimize}   && Y({\bm \alpha},{\bm q}({\bm \alpha}))            \nonumber           \\
%   {\rm with~respect~to}     && {\bm \alpha}                                     \label{eq:minimize} \\
%   {\rm subject~to} && {\cal R}({\bm \alpha},{\bm q}({\bm \alpha})) = 0 \nonumber           \\
%                    &&       C ({\bm \alpha},{\bm q}({\bm \alpha})) = 0 \,. \nonumber
% \end{eqnarray}

% It is also possible to use subequations.

% \begin{subequations}
%     \begin{equation}
%     \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left( \rho u_j \right) = 0 \,,
%     \label{eq:continuity}
%     \end{equation}
%     \begin{equation}
%     \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \rho u_i \right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \left( \rho u_i u_j + p \delta_{ij} - \tau_{ji} \right) = 0, \quad i=1,2,3 \,,
%     \label{eq:momentum}
%     \end{equation}
%     \begin{equation}
%         \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \rho E \right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \left( \rho E u_j + p u_j - u_i \tau_{ij} + q_j \right) = 0 \,.
%     \label{eq:energy}
%     \end{equation}
% \label{eq:NavierStokes}%
% \end{subequations}

% Notice that the equations should be punctuated as they are part of sentences, so a comma or a period should be put at the end of each of them, as exemplified in all the previous equations.

% When referencing an equation, use the abbreviation Eq., unless it is the beginning of a sentence.
% The number of the equation should always be in parenthesis.

% Equations~(\ref{eq:continuity}), (\ref{eq:momentum}) and (\ref{eq:energy}) form the Navier--Stokes equations~(Eq.~ (\ref{eq:NavierStokes})).

% \subsection{Tables}
% \label{section:tables}

% Insert your subsection material and for instance a few tables.

% Make sure all tables presented are referenced in the text!

% The caption should appear above the table.

% Follow some guidelines when making tables:

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Avoid vertical lines;
%   \item Avoid “boxing up” cells, usually 3 horizontal lines are enough: above, below, and after heading;
%   \item Avoid double horizontal lines;
%   \item Add enough space between rows.
% \end{itemize}

% \begin{table}[!htb]
%   \caption[Table caption shown in TOC.]{Table caption.}

% When referencing a table, use the abbreviation Tab., unless it is the beginning of a sentence.

% Tables~\ref{tab:memory} and \ref{tab:multipleColumns} are examples of tables with merging columns:
